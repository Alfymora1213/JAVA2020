Just as an aside, let us think about _multiple_ inheritance.
In some situations, it might be useful for a class to have multiple parents/superclasses.
This would allow it to derive methods and attributes from numerous different sources.
This is however dangerous - watch the first video above to find out why !

Java's solution to this is to only use single inheritance, but to augment this with interfaces. Watch the 2nd video above to gain an understanding of how this works.
Although a bit of a comprimise, this mechanism allows us to gain some of the benefits of multiple inheritance, whilst avoiding some of the pitfalls.

The aim of this session is to introduce further features of the Java programming language.
Each section provides some teaching materials (typically written material, slides and video)
that introduces a concept, as well as an activity to undertake that will allow you to apply your
freshly-gained knowledge. In this workbook we continue with the triangle exercise from last week
and you will get the opportunity to extend it with additional features and functionality.

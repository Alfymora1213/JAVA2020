In the previous task, we counted the number of Triangles in the array whilst looping through it.
But there is an alternative way to do this (without putting code inside the loop).
We can maintain a counter of how many Triangles have been created _inside_ the Triangle class itself
(incrementing this each time one is instantiated).
But their is a problem - we only want _one_ counter for the whole programme
(not a counter for each and every Triangle)

View the slides and audio narration above to gain an understanding of the difference
between _instance_ and _class_ variables. Then add an integer _class_ variable to your Triangle class to
keep track of how many Triangles have been created (don't forget to increment this in the constructor !).
Add a `getPopulation` method to your Triangle class that returns the current value of this counter variable.

Update your main method, so that it prints out the number of Triangles that existing using
this population counter _as well as_ the previous counter inside the loop
(just to make sure both counters agree !)

Just as we can create _class variables_ that are associated with the class (rather than each instance),
we can also write _class methods_ which are similarly associated with the class (not the instances).
You have already encountered just such a class method (namely the `random` method of the `Math` class).
Have a think about why you might wish to write a class method, rather than an instance method.
Considering the Triangle class - might some of its methods be better suited to being _class_ methods,
rather than _instance_ methods ?

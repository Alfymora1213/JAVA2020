Arrays in Java are very similar to those in C. In Java, they can hold primatives
(e.g. `int`, `float`, `char`, `boolean` etc)
but also complex Objects such as Strings, Robots or even Triangles !

Take a look at the video segments above for more information on arrays in Java.
Then (in you main method) create an array of 100 elements that can hold `TwoDimentionalShapes`.
Fill this array with randomly chosen shapes (Circles, Rectangles, Triangles).

Once you have filled the array with 100 shapes, loop through it and print details of each shape.
At the end of your program, print out a summary of how many Triangles were encountered in the array.

We have provided a <a href="code/TriangleTester.java" target="_blank">TriangleTester</a>
class that contains a variety of test cases to help you develop your class.
The test class makes use of "Assertions" so you will need to enable these when you run the test
class by using the following on the command line: `java -ea TriangleTester`
(or by adding `-ea` to the command line parameters of your IDE).

When testing your code using the testing class, focus on each type of triangle in turn
(first Equilateral, then Isosceles, then Scalene etc.). Make sure your code passes all of the tests
for that type before moving on to the next.

The final group of tests (to do with overflow) are more difficult, so leave those until the end.
These may require you to refactor your code a fair bit (depending on how you wrote it in the first place) !

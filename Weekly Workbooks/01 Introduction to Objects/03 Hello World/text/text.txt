The first program that you write in most languages is "Hello World". Take a look at the slide and video above that describe "Hello World" in java. Then copy and paste the code (from the slide) into a file called `HelloWorld.java` (note that you can edit java code with any editor you like, although we do recommend Intellij)
It is worth remembering that all Java source code files **must** have a `.java` extension.

To compile your source code file into bytecode, you will need to run `javac HelloWorld.java` on the command line (assuming you have java installed and on your path !) This produces a bytecode file with a `.class` extension. Then to run the program you use `java HelloWorld`. Try this now for your "Hello World" program to make sure you can compile and run java code.

Even if you plan to use an IDE (such as IntelliJ) for programming on this unit, it would still be a good idea to use the command line to compile "Hello World" - if only to get a feel for the process.

There is no point playing the game if nobody can actually win !
Add code to your controller that will detect when a win has been achieved.
You should check for wins in all directions (horizontally, vertically and diagonally).
Horizontal, Vertical are relatively easy (Diagonals are a bit more tricky !)

You should attempt to make your `OXOController` as flexible and versatile as possible.
It should therefore be able to perform win detection on grids of any size (not just 3x3).
Remember that for bigger grids, it is possible to set the number of cells in a row required to win
(the "Win Threshold"). This is done when initially instantiating the `OXOModel`, or by changing
it dynamically during a game using the `setWinThreshold` method.

Note that you are not responsible for checking that the win threshold is achievable
(i.e. that the board is wide or high enough to allow the win threshold to be reached).

Note that when someone has won, the game should not accept any further inputted commands.
There is no need to worry about resetting the game (if the users wish to play again)
it is the responsibility of the `OXOView` to manage this.

Add appropriate input checking features to your `handleIncomingCommand` method to trap any
invalid inputs entered by the user. When an error is detected, you should instantiate and
then "throw" the relevant exception, (depending on the type of input error that has been made).
The `OXOView` will then "catch" these exceptions and print out a relevant error message to the command line as feedback to the user.

You may assume a maximum grid size of 9x9 (rows `a`-`i` and columns `1`-`9`)
so that a cell identifier can only ever be two characters long.
Note that your code should accept upper as well as lower case row characters
(e.g. `A1` and `a1` are equivalent and both acceptable).

Test your program by playing a game and entering a range of erroneous inputs,
Making sure that all errors are trapped and reported.

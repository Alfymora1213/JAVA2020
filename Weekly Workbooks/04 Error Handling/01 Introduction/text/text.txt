In this workbook, we will extend the OXO game that you started last week.
Currently it is possible for a user to make a mistake and input a "bad" cell identifier
(for example, a cell that doesn't exist or one that is already taken by another player)

On receiving a cell position, your code should check to make sure the specified cell is valid
before allowing the player to claim that cell. If the cell position is not valid, your code
should prevent the move from taking place and should then notify the game application
that an error has occurred. In Java there is a special mechanism for handling these kinds of errors...

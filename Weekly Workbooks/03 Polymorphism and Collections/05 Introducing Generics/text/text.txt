One solution to the problems identified in the previous section is a Java mechanism called _Generics_.
This mechanism allows us to designate a particular compound data structure to hold a specific object type.
This allows us to make use of untyped data structures, whilst at the same time enforcing type checking at compile time.
View the video above to gain an understanding of how the use of generics achieves this.

Java provides a number of very useful compound data structures in the _Collections_ package.
These all make use of the Generics mechanism outlined previously.
Watch the video linked to above for an introduction into the _Collections_ package.
Use this knowledge to convert the board grid data structure in the `OXOModel` class from an Array to an

Note that there is no need to test dynamically changing the board size at this stage.
Reimplementing the `OXOModel` with `ArrayLists` is enough for the time being.
You will get to test your changes to the `OXOModel` in the next section...

In order to fully test out your changes to the `OXOModel` class we need to actually play a game - so in this task
you will make the game interactive ! Players will take it in turns to enter desired cell position
into the `OXOView` GUI window (see video above). Note that the order of player turns should be the same as the order that players
have been added to the model (i.e. the first player added to the game will take the first go, followed by the second)

A cell position consists of the row letter and the column number of the cell a player wishes to "claim".
For example, if a user wished to claim the centre cell of a 3x3 board, they would type: `b2`.
Cell identifiers entered via the `OXOView` will be automatically passed to the `OXOController`
(via a call to the `handleIncomingCommand` method).

Note that you should set the "current player" to be the player _whose turn it is next_, so that the view shows graphically the player who is about to take a turn.

It is possible that the user may make a mistake when interacting with the system and enter a "bad" cell identifier.
Do not try to deal with these here - we will address error handling in the next workbook.
For the time being, you may assume that any cell identifiers entered by the user are always valid.
